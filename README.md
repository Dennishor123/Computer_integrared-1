CIM Digital Twin Exercise 1

**Goal 1: Create a single box in blender or omniverse create using python script.**

Description:
1) The python script is written in single_box.py. 
2) The script creates a new mesh object for the box, and sets its vertices and faces to define its shape. 
3) It then creates new mesh objects for the smaller cover and the larger cover, and sets their vertices and faces as well.
4) The script adds a material to the box, which sets its color to a dark brown shade.
5) The objects are then linked to the scene, and the box object is set as active.
6) You can modify the script to change the size, position, or color of the objects by modifying the values of the variables in the script.

**Goal 2: Create random multiple boxes in blender or omniverse create using python script. You may import any conveyor system and obj file from Luma AI into the same environment.**

Description:
1) The python script is written in multiple_box.py. 
2) This is a Python script for Blender that creates three boxes with random positions within a given range. 
3) The boxes are created using vertices and faces to form a mesh object.
4) The script first creates a mesh object for a single box with fixed vertices and faces.
5) It then creates three instances of this box with random positions by modifying the position of the vertices before creating the mesh object.
6) Finally, the script sets the location of each box object and links it to the Blender scene.
